This repository contains various programming solutions in the C programming language ....
Below are various C programs and the solutions of them can be find in my GitHub account...please search for the solutions by maintaining the question number.

1. Write a C program to find out the sum of the following series:
    S = 1!/1 + 2!/2 + 3!/3 + 4!/4 + â€¦ + n!/n 
    
2. Write a C program to check whether a given number is ABUNDANT or not. An abundant number is a special type of number for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than the number itself. Make use of user-defined functions as and when necessary.
